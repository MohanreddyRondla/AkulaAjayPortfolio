            <p>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree in India is an undergraduate academic degree conferred after the completion of a four-year full-time engineering program from All India Council for Technical Education recognised institute.[citation needed] The B.Tech. degree is generally awarded by Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) (India), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs) or other Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs) and private deemed universities in various engineering disciplines such as Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Cyber Security and many more. This degree is generally equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering offered in other Affiliated Engineering colleges of State Collegiate universities or a Bachelor of Science in Engineering or Bachelor of Engineering in the United States and Europe.[2][additional citation(s) needed]

            </p><p>Eligibility for a B.Tech. program in India typically requires candidates to have completed their higher secondary education (10+2) with mandatory subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry or other technical subjects.[3] Institutions often set a minimum aggregate percentage requirement, usually 75% and the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main is a prominent entrance exam for B.Tech. admissions, comprising questions in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.[4] JEE Advanced is the subsequent exam for those trying to enter the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Admission to National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), MIT Vishwaprayag University, Solapur[5] other Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs) and deemed universities like Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad are based on JEE Main scores.</p>

            </p><p>The language laboratory consists of <b>“COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING LAB (CALL)”</b>, where the students are provided with a specialized software (WALDEN) to work with, a computer and a headset under the supervision of concerned faculty. This lab is intended to improve the pronunciation of the students and helps the students to understand the internationally standard pronunciation. And the next part is named as ”INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION SKILLS LAB (ICS)”, wherein the students follow the instructions of the faculty and participate in various individual and group activities which enable the students to communicate. The outcome of this lab is that, the students are motivated to speak in English by participating in various individual and group activities making Jyothishmathi Engg college Karimnagar a top B.tech college in Telangana.
